Vista ECP BUS Propeller Implementation

Receive keypad display from panel and send keypad keys to panel.

The panel is the Ademco Vista 15P / 20P panels, or any system that uses their ECP BUS.

All you will need to do is add a couple of opto-isolators and a few resistors to a propeller 
demo board and you will be able to retrieve the status of your alarm system and arm and disarm
and anything else you could normally do from the keypad.

If you are able to debug any additional messages that this project doesn't already include, plese
feel free to submit the info or update the object.
